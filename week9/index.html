    <h3>Novice to Ninja Chapter 9 - The Window Object</h3>
    <p>Browser Object Model - collection of properties and methods that contain
        information about the browser and computer screen. It can also be used for popups (althought these should be
        avoided).</p>
        <li>window.alert() method pauses the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box.
            The message is provided as an argument to the method, and undefined is always returned.</li>
        <li>window.confirm() method stops the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog
            that shows the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel. It returns the
            boolean values of true if the user clicks OK, and false if the user clicks Cancel.</li>
        <li>window.prompt() method stops the execution of the program. It displays a dialog that shows a
            message provided as an argument, as well as an input field that allows the user to enter text. This text
            is then returned as a string when the user clicks OK. If the user clicks Cancel, null is returned.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>window.navigator - The Navigator object contains information about the browser being used. Its userAgent
            property will return information about the browser and operating system being used. (remember that this
            can be altered by the browser so it can be inaccurate)</li>
        <li>window.location - The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of
            the current page. It contains a number of properties that provide information about different fragments
            of the URL.</li>
        <ul>
            <h4><strong>window.location properties</strong></h4>
            <li>protocol property returns a string describing the protocol used (such as http, https, pop2, ftp
                etc.). Note that there is a colon (:) at the end</li>
            <li>host property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL and the port number
                (this is often omitted if the default port 80 is used)</li>
            <li>hostname property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL</li>
            <li>port property returns a string describing the port number, although it will return an empty
                string if the port is not explicitly stated in the URL</li>
            <li>pathname property returns a string of the path that follows the domain</li>
            <li>search property returns a string that starts with a “?” followed by the query string parameters.
                It returns an empty string if there are no query string parameters</li>
            <li>hash property returns a string that starts with a “#” followed by the fragment identifier. It
                returns an empty string if there is no fragment identifier</li>
            <li>origin property returns a string that shows the protocol and domain where the current page
                originated from. This property is read-only, so cannot be changed</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <h4><strong>window.location methods</strong> </h4>
        </ul>
        <li>reload() method can be used to force a reload of the current page. If it’s given a parameter of
            true, it will force the browser to reload the page from the server, instead of using a cached page</li>
        <li>assign() method can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as a parameter</li>
        <li>replace() method is almost the same as the assign() method, except the current page will not be
            stored in the session history, so the user will be unable to navigate back to it using the back button
        </li>
        <li>TtoString() method returns a string containing the whole URL</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h4><strong>window.history properties</strong></h4>
        <li>window.history.length property shows how many pages have been visited before arriving at the current
            page</li>
        <li>window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page, where 0 is the current page</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each window object contains a document object. This object has properties and methods that deal with the page
        that has been loaded into the window.</p>
    <p>Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer. They were invented by Netscape as a way
        of getting round HTTP being a stateless protocol. This means that a browser does not remember anything from
        one request to another. So every time a user visits a page, nothing about any previous visits is remembered.
        Cookies can be used to sidestep this problem by storing information that can then be retrieved between
        requests.</p>
    <p>window object provides useful methods for scheduling the execution of a function, also to repeatedly
        execute functions at regular intervals.</p>
