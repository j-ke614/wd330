    <h1>Week 4 Notes</h1>
        <ul>   
        <p>Chapter 10 Testing and Debugging. Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings. System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.

            Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.
            
            User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.

            exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.

            An exception will also produce a stack trace. This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.

            A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash.

            Linting tools such as JS Lint, JS Hint, and ES Lint can be used to test the quality of JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict mode.

            Programming in JavaScript can be something of a moving target as the APIs it uses are in a constant state of flux.

            Most modern JavaScript environments have a console object that provides a number of methods for logging information and debugging. It's not officially part of the ECMAScript specification, but is well supported in all the major browsers and Node.js.

            One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword. This will create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code and allow you to see where the program is currently up to.
            
            An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor function

            The throw statement can be applied to any JavaScript expression, causing the execution of the program to stop.

            Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code
